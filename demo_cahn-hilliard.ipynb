    "-------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The Cahn-Hilliard equation is a parabolic equation and is typically used\n",
    "to model phase separation in binary mixtures. It involves first-order\n",
    "time derivatives, and second- and fourth-order spatial derivatives. The\n",
    "equation reads:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} - \\nabla \\cdot M \\left(\\nabla\\left(\\frac{d f}{d c}\n",
    "          - \\lambda \\nabla^{2}c\\right)\\right) &= 0 \\quad {\\rm in} \\ \\Omega, \\\\\n",
    "M\\left(\\nabla\\left(\\frac{d f}{d c} - \\lambda \\nabla^{2}c\\right)\\right) \\cdot n &= 0 \\quad {\\rm on} \\ \\partial\\Omega, \\\\\n",

    "\n",
    "### Mixed form\n",
    "\n",
    "The Cahn-Hilliard equation is a fourth-order equation, so casting it in\n",

    "\n",
    "The unknown fields are now $c$ and $\\mu$. The weak (variational) form of\n",
    "the problem reads: find $(c, \\mu) \\in V\n",
    "\\times V$ such that\n",
