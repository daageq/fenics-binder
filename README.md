# fenics-binder
This repository consists of software which is used to make FEniCS demos written as notebooks available for direct use.
For information about [Binder](http://mybinder.org/).

## For developers
If you want to use your own FEniCS version to create .ipynb files from the FEniCS demos, replace content of the string 
`fenics_dir` with the path to your FEniCS installation in `rst-to-ipynb-demos.py`
